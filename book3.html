      Harry Potter is lucky to reach the age of thirteen, since he has
      survived the murderous attacks of the feared Dark Lord on more than
      one occasion. His hopes for a quiet school term concentrating on
      Quidditch are dashed, though, when a maniacal mass-murderer escapes
      from Azkaban, pursued by the soul-sucking Dementors who guard the
      prison. It's assumed that Hogwarts is the safest place for Harry to
      be. But is it his imagination that is making him feel eyes watching
      him in the dark, and should he be taking Professor Trelawney's
      ghoulish predictions seriously?
