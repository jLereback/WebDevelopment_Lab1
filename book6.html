    <p>
      As the Dark Lord's sinister forces amass, a spirit of gloom and fear is sweeping the land. Harry Potter waits
      nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' for Professor Dumbledore to arrive. One of the last times he saw the
      Headmaster was in a fierce duel with Voldemort at the Ministry of Magic. Why is the Professor coming to visit him
      now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts? In his sixth year, Harry will discover the
      secret behind the Half-Blood Prince, as Professor Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny.
