      <p>
        As the Dark Lord's sinister forces amass, a spirit of gloom and fear is sweeping the land. Harry Potter waits
        nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys' for Professor Dumbledore to arrive. One of the last times he saw the
        Headmaster was in a fierce duel with Voldemort at the Ministry of Magic. Why is the Professor coming to visit
        him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts? In his sixth year, Harry will discover the
        secret behind the Half-Blood Prince, as Professor Dumbledore prepares him to face his destiny.
