      Harry Potter can't wait for his holidays with the dire Dursleys to
      end. But a small, self-punishing house-elf warns Harry of mortal
      danger awaiting him at Hogwarts. Returning to the castle nevertheless,
      Harry hears a rumour about a Chamber of Secrets, holding unknown
      horrors for wizards of Muggle parentage. Now someone is casting spells
      that turn people to stone, and a terrible warning is found painted on
      the wall. The chief suspect - always in the wrong place - is Harry.
      But something much more terrifying has yet to be unleashed.
