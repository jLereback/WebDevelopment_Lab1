    <p>
      Harry Potter is furious that he is stuck at the Dursleys' house for the summer, when he suspects that Voldemort is
      gathering an army, and the wizarding authorities seem unwilling to do anything. Harry's so-called friends are
      trying to keep him in the dark. But he knows that Voldemort's forces can find him wherever he is; he could be
      attacked at any moment. Harry is finally rescued from Privet Drive by members of the Order of the Phoenix - a
      secret society first formed years ago to fight Voldemort - and discovers that maybe he is not alone in this battle
      after all.
