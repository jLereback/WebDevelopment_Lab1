      When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that
      apparently he's the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord's curse when Harry was just a
      baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts, a wizarding school
      brimming with ghosts and enchantments, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog
      guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers which could be
      valuable, dangerous - or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!
