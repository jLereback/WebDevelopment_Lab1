      <p>
        Harry Potter is preparing to leave the Dursleys and Privet Drive for the last time. But the future that awaits
        him is full of danger, not only for him, but for anyone close to him - and Harry has already lost so much. Only
        by destroying Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes can Harry free himself and overcome the Dark Lord's forces of
        evil. In this dramatic conclusion to the Harry Potter series, Harry must leave his most loyal friends behind,
        and in a final perilous journey find the strength and the will to face his terrifying destiny: a deadly
        confrontation that is his alone to fight.
