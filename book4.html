    <p>
      When the Quidditch World Cup is disrupted by Voldemort's rampaging
      supporters and the terrifying Dark Mark appears against the night sky,
      it is obvious to Harry Potter that, far from weakening, Voldemort is
      getting stronger. Back at Hogwarts for the fourth year Harry is
      astonished to be chosen to represent the school in the Triwizard
      Tournament. The competition is dangerous, the tasks terrifying, and
      true courage is no guarantee of survival - especially with the Dark
      Lord's forces on the rise.
